# Intro

Hello everyone,

My name is Ish. I'm currently a junior studying DSA, and I cannot believe I'm learning an amazing stuff like this!

## What I've Learned
- Git basics, including cloning repositories and branching.
- How to pull request when needed

## What I'm Still Confused About
- How to handle merge conflicts effectively.
- Best practices for collaborative work on Git.

I'm excited to learn more and improve my skills.

Best,
Ish
